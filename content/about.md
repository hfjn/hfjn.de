Hi. I'm Jannik and this is my personal blog. I like coffee, written stuff (as code or texts) and lousy humor. 

I grew up in a small town in Western Germany. Here I early realized that answering other peoples computer questions and understanding computers in general was one of my strong suits. After finishing high school I went to university in Osnabr체ck, Jyv채skyl채 and M체nster from which I graduated in 2017 with a Master's degree in Information Systems. During my studies I learned a lot of the interconnection of economics and computer science and also got to know the sheer excitement of answering questions with data and self-built systems. 

I currently fulfill this obsessions for data and question answering as a Data Scientist at [real.digital](https://real-digital.de) in Cologne, Germany.

I also have a CV, if you want one.
